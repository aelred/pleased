0) AUTHOR: Luisa (Unifi)
1) DATE and TIME: 15/05/2013_17.10
2) DURATION of the experiments: about 114 hrs
3) GOAL: show that repetitive treatments with high concentration of ozone cause variation potentials.
4) STIMULUS: 1 minute esposition to ozone every 2 hours starting from hour 68 (mark=ozono1) until the end
	- PATTERN: 68 hrs af spontaneous activity and 46 hrs with stimuli. NB: it is a preliminary exp, so ignore very high noise due to electrode adjustment.
	- OZONE CONCENTRATION: T0: 16 ppm; T1: 6.2 ppm; T2: 2.61 ppm; T3: 0.89 ppm; T4: 0.27 ppm; T5: 0.05 ppm; T6: 0.01 ppm (data taken every 15 minutes after ozone spray)	 
5) MATERIAL
5.1) EXPERIMENTAL ENVIRONMENT:

	- temperature: 22°C
	- humidity: 39%
	- light: LED programmed for 12 hrs ON and 12 hrs OFF; NB: light ON increases signal noise.
5.2) PLANT:

	- ALREADY USED FOR THE EXPERIMENTS: never
5.3) ELECTRODES: 
	- TYPE: needles for electromyography
	- NUMBER: three
	- PLACEMENT: base of the stem=ground; medium=ch1; top= ch2; electrodes ch1 and ch2 are placed at a distance of 6 cm between them.
5.4) DEVICES: 
	- TYPE: WPI electrometer duo 773

5.5) NOTE on the experimental SETUP.
6) DATA FORMAT: iwxdta (with events)
6.1) TOOLS to IMPORT and VISUALIZE the experiments:
	- Labscribe2 to filter and visualize data
	- plugin for TDMS to XLS http://zone.ni.com/devzone/cda/epd/p/id/2944
7) OBSERVATIONS
It is a preliminary exp, so ignore very high noise due to preliminary setup.
