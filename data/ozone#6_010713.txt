Ozone#6

0) AUTHOR: Luisa (Unifi)
1) DATE and TIME: 01/07/2013 (start)
2) DURATION of the experiments: about 24 hrs
3) GOAL: show that repetitive treatments with high concentration of ozone cause variation potentials.
4) STIMULUS: 1 minute esposition to ozone every 2 hours starting from min 29:42 (mark=ozone1), for 18 hrs (10 sprays)
	- PATTERN: about 30 min of spontaneous activity, about 18 hrs with repetitive stimuli, and more that 5 hrs without stimuli.
	- OZONE CONCENTRATION: T0: 14.72 ppm; T1: 4.79 ppm; T2: 2.53 ppm; T3: 1.34 ppm; T4: 0.59 ppm; T5: 0.24 ppm; T6: 0.07 ppm; 
	T7: 0.02 ppm; T8: 0.01 ppm (data taken every 15 minutes after ozone spray)
