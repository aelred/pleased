H2SO4#6

0) AUTHOR: Luisa (Unifi)
1) DATE and TIME: 06/06/2013
2) DURATION of the experiments: about 2 hrs
3) GOAL: show that the addiction of sulfuric acid in the soil causes variation potentials.
4) STIMULUS: addiction of 5 ml of 0.05 M H2SO4 in the soil (mark)
	- PATTERN: 1 hr of spontaneous activity, stimulus and 1 hr recording after stimulus.	 
5) MATERIAL
5.1) EXPERIMENTAL ENVIRONMENT: 
	- plant surrounded by a metal fence, positioned inside an obscured Faraday cage 
	- a silicone tube inserted into plant soil to inject the sulfuric acid
	- temperature: 22°C
	- humidity: 39%
	- light: led panel grow light 
5.2) PLANT: 
	- SPECIES: 2 tomatoes
	- AGE: ~ 3 weeks 
	- PHOTO: 0
	- ALREADY USED FOR THE EXPERIMENTS: never
5.3) ELECTRODES: 
	- TYPE: needles for electromyography
	- NUMBER: three for each plant
	- PLACEMENT Plant 1: base of the stem=ground; medium=ch1; top= ch2; electrodes ch1 and ch2 are placed at a distance of 8 cm between them.
	- PLACEMENT Plant 2: base of the stem=ground; medium=ch3; top= ch4; electrodes ch3 and ch4 are placed at a distance of 4 cm between them.

5.4) DEVICES: 
	- TYPE: WPI electrometer Duo-773 (plant 1); WI electrometer HiZ-223 (plant 2)
