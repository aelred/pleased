Ozone#2

0) AUTHOR: Luisa (Unifi)
1) DATE and TIME: 20/05/2013 (end)
2) DURATION of the experiments: about 97 hrs (with interruptions).
3) GOAL: show that repetitive treatments with high concentration of ozone cause variation potentials.
4) STIMULUS: 1 minute esposition to ozone every 1 or 2 hours starting from ozone1 (see OBSERVATION at the bottom).
	- PATTERN: 24 hrs of spontaneous activity, 18 hrs with repetitive stimuli, and 55 hrs more without stimuli.
	- OZONE CONCENTRATION: T0: 16 ppm; T1: 6.2 ppm; T2: 2.61 ppm; T3: 0.89 ppm; T4: 0.27 ppm; T5: 0.05 ppm; T6: 0.01 ppm (data taken every 15 minutes after ozone spray)	 
5) MATERIAL
5.1) EXPERIMENTAL ENVIRONMENT: 
	- plexiglass box, covered with metal fence, positioned inside an Obscured Faraday cage 
	- temperature: 22°C
	- humidity: 39%
	- light: white LED programmed for 12 hrs ON and 12 hrs OFF; NB: light ON increases signal noise.
5.2) PLANT: 
	- SPECIES: 2 tomatoes
	- AGE: ~ 3 weeks 
	- PHOTO: 4
	- ALREADY USED FOR THE EXPERIMENTS: never
5.3) ELECTRODES: 
	- TYPE: needles for electromyography
	- NUMBER: three for each plant
	- PLACEMENT Plant 1: base of the stem=ground; medium=ch1; top= ch2; electrodes ch1 and ch2 are placed at a distance of 3 cm between them.
	- PLACEMENT Plant 2: base of the stem=ground; medium=ch3; top= ch4; electrodes ch3 and ch4 are placed at a distance of 3 cm between them.

5.4) DEVICES: 
	- TYPE: WPI electrometer duo 773 (plant 1); WI electrometer HiZ-223 (plant 2)

	- ACCURACY: 12 bits/sample
5.5) NOTE on the experimental SETUP.
6) DATA FORMAT: iwxdta (with events)
6.1) TOOLS to IMPORT and VISUALIZE the experiments:
	- Labscribe2 to filter and visualize data
	- plugin for TDMS to XLS http://zone.ni.com/devzone/cda/epd/p/id/2944
7) OBSERVATIONS
	within the file there are interruptions due to set-up adjustments (marks 'restart light timer' and 'setup adju'); 
	furthermore the first 4 sprays ozone are not regular:
	ozone1 -> 10.30 AM (see TimeOfDay)
	ozone2 -> 12.00 PM
	ozone3 ->  1.00 PM
	ozone4 ->  2.30 PM
	ozone5 ->  6.30 PM
	ozone6 ->  8.30 PM
	ozone7 -> 10.30 PM
	ozone8 -> 12.30 AM
	ozone9 ->  3.30 AM
	ozone10 -> 4.30 AM
